Static Code Analysis - FindBugs Demo

I've included a copy of my presentation notes in "Static Code Analysis Presentation Notes.docx"



	In this project I implemented the FindBugs Static Code Analysis plugin for Java
and showed off a variety of errors that it can pick out. In the presentation I demonstrated
how to fine-tune bug-finding in FindBugs and three types of reporting that it can offer:
1. Integrated IDE view with line-by-line reporting using my written buggy code
2. FindBugs GUI view with the ability to add comments/flags to bugs and advanced grouping/filtering 
	options using the iBox project
3. Holistic HTML view with package and bug type categorization using example runs from releases of 
	JDK and Eclipse
The presentation also included a overview of what techniques are used to create a static code
analysis tool, when one is best used, and their shortcomings.
